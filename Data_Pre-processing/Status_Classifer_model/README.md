## üß© Feature Engineering Rationale

Feature engineering was performed to transform raw sensor data into **interpretable, model-friendly insights**.
Here‚Äôs the reasoning behind each engineered feature:

| Feature                    | Rationale                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Relative_Soil_Saturation` | Helps determine when the soil is close to saturation and irrigation can be paused to prevent overwatering.                     |
| `temp_diff`                | Large temperature gaps between soil and air can signal poor moisture retention or excessive evaporation.                       |
| `wind_effect`              | Wind increases evapotranspiration; combining gusts and average wind gives a better estimate of drying intensity.               |
| `Evapotranspiration`       | A key hydrological variable representing total water demand ‚Äî essential for precise irrigation scheduling.                     |
| `rain_3days`               | Recent rainfall influences soil moisture levels; tracking 3-day accumulation provides temporal context.                        |
| `rain_vs_soil`             | Balances rainfall against soil moisture to understand infiltration efficiency ‚Äî high ratio may indicate runoff.                |
| `np_ratio` / `nk_ratio`    | Nutrient ratios are more informative than absolute values for diagnosing crop nutrient balance.                                |
| `ph_category`              | Converts continuous pH into interpretable soil-type groups for model readability and easier correlation with crop preferences. |
| `ph_encoded`               | Provides a numeric version of pH categories for ML models requiring numerical inputs.                                          |
