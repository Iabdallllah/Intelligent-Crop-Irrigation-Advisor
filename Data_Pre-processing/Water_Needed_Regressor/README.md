## üåæ Intelligent Crop Irrigation Advisor


### üß© Dataset Description

**File:** `Final_irregation_optimization_data_m2.csv` We used the data set of the Status Classifer model and add to it more Features 

Each row represents a daily record of soil, crop, and weather conditions with the corresponding irrigation recommendations.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Summary

1. **Data Loading & Inspection**

   * Read dataset using pandas.
   * Display structure, missing values, and duplicates.

2. **Feature Importance Extraction**

   * Load a pre-trained `CatBoost` model (`catboost_model.pkl`).
   * Visualize feature importance to understand influential factors in irrigation needs.

3. **Water & Nutrient Simulation**

   * Iterates through each data row to:

     * Compute **ETc (Evapotranspiration √ó Kc)**.
     * Calculate **water deficit** adjusted by soil moisture and rainfall.
     * Recommend **NPK values** based on crop, pH, and irrigation level.
   * Updates soil moisture dynamically after each irrigation step.
   * Results stored in `irrigation_npk_scientific_safe.csv`.
