# üíß Secure IoT Environmental Monitoring System

This project implements a complete, secure Internet of Things (IoT) pipeline for real-time environmental data collection and analysis. It uses an ESP32 microcontroller for sensing and a FastAPI service for cloud ingestion into a Supabase database.

---

## üöÄ Architecture and Data Flow
The system is designed for reliability and security, utilizing industry-standard protocols for end-to-end data transfer.

**Data Path:**
1. **ESP32:** Reads sensor data, formats it into a JSON payload.
2. **MQTT (TLS/SSL):** Publishes the JSON payload securely to the cloud broker over Port 8883.
3. **HiveMQ Cloud:** Acts as the private, managed MQTT Broker.
4. **FastAPI Ingestion Service:** Subscribes to the topic via Secure WebSocket (WSS/8884), handles authentication, and processes the incoming data.
5. **Supabase:** The final destination where data is stored in a PostgreSQL table for analysis and visualization.

## üõ†Ô∏è Components

### Hardware & Sensing
| Component         | Function                                              |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| ESP32             | Main processing unit; runs embedded C++ for connectivity and control. |
| DHT11             | Measures real-time Temperature and Humidity.         |
| Rain Sensor       | Detects and reports Rain Status (e.g., wet/dry).     |
| Water Level Sensor| Measures and reports Water Level.                    |
| Soil Moisture     | Measures and reports soil moisture                   |
| Servo Motor       | Controlled actuator for physical interaction (e.g., opening a vent). |
| LCD/Keypad        | Local interface for display and input.               |

### Software & Cloud Services
| Component      | Role                                              | Protocol/Language |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| HiveMQ Cloud   | Managed MQTT Broker for messaging between device and server. | MQTT (TLS/WSS)  |
| FastAPI        | Python Web API framework used for the Subscriber and Ingestion Service. | Python           |
| Supabase       | Backend-as-a-Service (PostgreSQL database) for persistent storage. | SQL, REST         |
| paho-mqtt      | Python library used by FastAPI to handle MQTT connection. | Python           |

## üíæ Supabase Database Schema
The ingested data is stored in the `sensor_readings` table with the following structure:

| Column Name   | Data Type     | Source         | Description                       |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| id            | uuid         | Auto-generated| Primary key.                      |
| created_at    | timestampz   | Auto-generated| Time of record insertion.         |
| temperature   | float        | DHT11         | Ambient temperature reading.      |
| humidity      | float        | DHT11         | Ambient humidity reading.         |
| soil_moisture | float        | (Sensor)      | Reading for soil moisture levels. |
| rain_status   | boolean/int  | Rain Sensor   | Current rain detection status.    |
| water_level   | float        | Water Level Sensor | Raw water level reading.     |
| servo_angle   | int          | ESP32         | Angle of the controlled servo motor. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Deployment

### Prerequisites
1. **Supabase Account:** Database URL and Service Role Key.
2. **HiveMQ Cloud Account:** Broker URL, Port 8883, WSS Port 8884, MQTT Username, and Password.
3. **Python Environment:** Python 3.9+ with fastapi, uvicorn, paho-mqtt, supabase-py, and python-dotenv.
4. **Arduino/PlatformIO:** Environment for compiling and flashing the ESP32 code.

### 1. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the FastAPI project and populate it with your private cloud credentials:
```env
# Supabase
SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project-ref.supabase.co"
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY="your-supabase-key"

# HiveMQ Cloud (WSS Path added directly to Broker URL for compatibility)
MQTT_BROKER="<YOUR_HIVE_MQ_CLOUD_URL>/mqtt" 
MQTT_PORT="8884" 
MQTT_USER="your_mqtt_username" 
MQTT_PASSWORD="your_mqtt_password"
MQTT_TOPIC="user/7/rain_data"
```

### 2. Run the Ingestion Service
Start the FastAPI application (the MQTT subscriber):
```bash
uvicorn data_ingestion:app --reload
```
The service will connect securely to HiveMQ and immediately begin listening for data, pushing any received JSON payloads into Supabase.

### 3. Deploy ESP32 Code
Ensure the ESP32 code is configured with the same MQTT_BROKER (on Port 8883, using WiFiClientSecure) and the same MQTT_TOPIC before flashing the device.
