## üåæ Intelligent Crop Irrigation Advisor

### üìò Overview

This project focuses on **data-driven irrigation and fertilizer optimization** using machine learning. It combines **environmental, soil, and weather data** to recommend the optimal water amount (in mm) and balanced NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) fertilizer values for different crops.

The model leverages **CatBoost Regression** to predict water requirements scientifically and efficiently, ensuring sustainable irrigation management.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Summary

1. **Data Loading & Inspection**

   * Read dataset using pandas.
   * Display structure, missing values, and duplicates.

2. **Feature Importance Extraction**

   * Load a pre-trained `CatBoost` model (`catboost_model.pkl`).
   * Visualize feature importance to understand influential factors in irrigation needs.

3. **Water & Nutrient Simulation**

   * Iterates through each data row to:

     * Compute **ETc (Evapotranspiration √ó Kc)**.
     * Calculate **water deficit** adjusted by soil moisture and rainfall.
     * Recommend **NPK values** based on crop, pH, and irrigation level.
   * Updates soil moisture dynamically after each irrigation step.
   * Results stored in `irrigation_npk_scientific_safe.csv`.

4. **Model Training (CatBoost Regressor)**

   * Uses `status = True` records (when soil needs water).
   * Features selected carefully to avoid multicollinearity.
   * Trains CatBoost model with:

     * 1000 iterations
     * Learning rate = 0.05
     * Depth = 8
     * Evaluation metric = R¬≤
   * Model performance metrics:

     * **MAE**
     * **RMSE**
     * **R¬≤ Score**
     * **Adjusted R¬≤**

5. **Model Saving**

   * The final model is saved as `catboost_irrigation_model.pkl`.
